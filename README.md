# Dissertation Chatbot

*A chatbot that interprets user queries about equity fund profitability and sustainability using Multiple-Response Regression models.*

---

## **Why I Built It**
- **Problem:** Financial analysis tools often lack user-friendly interfaces for querying complex statistical models.  
- **Motivation:** I wanted to bridge this gap by creating a chatbot that translates people's queries into insights using models from my dissertation.  
- **Goal:** Make complex statistical modelling (Multiple-Response Linear Regression (MRLR), Random Forests, XGBoost) accessible via a conversational interface.

## **Architecture Overview**
![Architecture Diagram](images/architecture.png)  

**Key Components:**
- **Chat Interface:** Streamlit (frontend UI)  
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) integrated with R models via Plumber or reticulate  
- **Models:** MRLR, Random Forest, XGBoost (trained on equity fund data)  
- **Hosting:** Deployed using Hugging Face Spaces and Gradio 

**Trade-offs:**
- Prioritised **interpretability over raw accuracy** by including MRLR for transparent predictions.
- Chose **FastAPI** for speed and async capabilities instead of Flask.
- Integrated **R models** rather than rewriting all models in Python to preserve the statistical accuracy of dissertation code.

## **What I Learned**
- **System Design:** Bridging R and Python environments for model serving requires efficient serialisation and caching to reduce latency.
- **Model Insights:** MRLR provided explainability for feature effects, while XGBoost offered improved predictive accuracy.
- **Soft Skills:** Improved ability to communicate complex modelling ideas to non-technical users through UI design.
